## Constructive Physics

### Introduction

Constructive Physics Project (CPP) is an attempt to construct physical theories in a logically self-complete formulation. Constructive Physics Project comprises a kernel and service packs. The kernel defines the fundamental concepts and necessary interfaces. The service packs provide extensions for theories worked with lower symmetry or under lower energy. The project is organized through distributed source code management.
