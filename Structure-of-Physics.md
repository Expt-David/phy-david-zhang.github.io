## Structure of Physics

### Introduction

This document illustrates the methodology and the construction of fundamental theory of Physics. We show how to derive a physical theory based solely on mathematical requirements on self-consistency (symmetric principle). However, it should be claimed that this may only represent the opinions of some theoretical physicists, which means it may not be a widely accepted view towards fundamental theory of Physics. Thus, discussions are welcomed.
